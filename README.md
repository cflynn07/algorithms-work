Algorithms-Work
---------------

I'm reading "Algorithms in a Nutshell" by George T. Heineman, Gary Pollice,
Stanley Selkow

The book contains examples of various algorithms with sample code written in C,
Python, Java. As an exercise, I want to try manually implementing the
algorithms in Golang, and that's the purpose of this repository.
